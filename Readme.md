# FoxLang and Theorem Prover

# Why the Name?

I was looking for a short and sweet name, and asked my 4-year-old what it should be, and here we are.

# What is FoxLang?

At it's core, FoxLang is an attempt at both creating a programming language and a theorem prover all at once.

Instead of "just" creating a theorem prover, I wanted to write a language that would serve as the core. In addition to 
enjoying language design, I wanted to write my own "math" language, since I was having trouble always typing upside down A's and backward E's.

I am currently in the process of writing a parser and lexer that will allow fox_lang to work with existing theorem provers
like MetaMath and Lean. Initial progress has been made with MetaMath, and several axioms can already be parsed and reduced.
